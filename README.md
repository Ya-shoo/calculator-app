# Calculator.Me
Calculator.Me is a modern, responsive web-based calculator. As part of The Odin Project curriculum, this project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and intuitive user experience for performing basic arithmetic operations
### Key Features
** Responsive Design ** : The calculator's layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across different screen sizes.
** Chain Calculations ** : The calculator can handle a sequence of operations, allowing you to continue a calculation with the result of the previous one (e.g., 10 + 5 = 15 * 2 = 30)
** Day/Night Mode ** : A toggle button allows users to switch between a light and dark theme, enhancing readability and reducing eye strain. The selected theme is saved using local storage, so it persists across sessions.
